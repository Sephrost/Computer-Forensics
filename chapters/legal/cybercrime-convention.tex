\chapter{Cybercrime Convention}
Because this part it \textit{really boring} we will start with an
example.
\section{E-commerce on the Dark Web}
The Dark Web provides a \textbf{platform} for buyers and sellers to
engage in e-commerce transactions, often involving \textbf{illicit
goods and services}, like guns, fake documents etc.. This anonymous
marketplace operates with the same principles as traditional
e-commerce, but with heightened security and privacy measures to
conceal identities.\\
Vendors on the Dark Web offer a wide range of products, from drugs and
weapons to stolen data and hacking services. Buyers can browse
listings, read reviews, and complete purchases using cryptocurrencies,
all while maintaining a high degree of anonymity.
\subsection{Silk Road}
Silk Road, often referred to as the "eBay of drugs," was an
\textbf{online marketplace}that facilitated the sale of a wide range
of illegal substances, including narcotics and controlled substances.
At its peak in 2013, Silk Road had a reported annual revenue of \$89.7
million.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Combining Tor, PGP, and Bitcoin}: Ross Ulbricht
    leveraged the anonymity of Tor, the encryption of PGP, and the
    decentralized nature of Bitcoin to create the Silk Road marketplace. 
  \item \textbf{Bitcoin-only Payments}: Silk Road required all
    transactions to be conducted using Bitcoin, providing an added layer
    of anonymity and making it harder to trace purchases.
  \item \textbf{User-friendly Interface}: Silk Road featured a well-designed
    interface that allowed users to easily navigate the site and leave
    feedback on their transactions.
  \item \textbf{Intermediary Role}: Silk Road acted as an intermediary
    between buyers and sellers, handling the payment process and
    logistics of shipping items purchased on the marketplace. This is
    one of the main sources of success of the platform.
\end{itemize}
At its peak, Silk Road had over 950,000 registered accounts, 1.2
million transactions, and nearly \$79 million in commissions. Ulbricht
was arrested in 2013 due to some critical mistakes, like using its
personal email to advertise the website and having counterfeit
documents delivered to his home address when he found out that he was
on investigation.\\
Ulbricht faced 7 key charges, including drug trafficking,
money laundering, and computer hacking, which were consolidated into 3
main counts against him and the trial ended in just 13 days with a
life sentence plus 180\$ million in damages.\\
What we can learn about this? First, the anonymity is really an issue
with ongoing investigations, but everyone can make mistakes, which
means that eventually, the law will catch up with you. Second,
everyone can create this kind of platform, which implies that is
necessary to solve the issue. For this purpose, cooperation is most
fundamental, and the Budapest Convention is the first step in this 
direction, by creating standards and protocols for international
cooperation in this field.

\section{Budapest Convention}
The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is an international
\textbf{treaty} that aims to address the challenges posed by
cybercrime and promote cooperation among countries in combating these
offenses.
It has three main purposes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Harmonizing national laws on cybercrime
  \item Improving investigative techniques
  \item Increasing international cooperation
\end{itemize}
In involves \textbf{68 countries}, including the United States,
Canada, and many European nations.
\begin{boxH}
  Keep in mind that the council of Europe and the European union are
  two different entities. The first one is able to invite entities
  that are outside of the latter one.
\end{boxH}

Some countries opposed to the convention like India, which has since
reconsidered, and Russia, which rejects it due to concerns about
sovereignty and refuses to cooperate too.\\
Other states has signed but no ratified (Ireland and South Africa),
which means that they are not bound by the convention(in this case is
just a principle declaration, without legal value).
\begin{boxH}
  The \textbf{difference} between signing and ratifying a treaty is
  that \textbf{signing} a treaty is a \textbf{preliminary step} that
  indicates a country's \textbf{intention to be bound} by the treaty,
  while \textbf{ratifying} a treaty is the \textbf{formal act} of
  \textbf{accepting} the treaty and agreeing to be bound by its terms.
  A country can sign a treaty without ratifying it, but it cannot
  ratify a treaty without signing it first.
\end{boxH}
The convention aims to help in the \textbf{fight against crimes} that
can only be committed through the \textbf{use of technology}, where
the devices are both the tool for committing the crime and the target
of the crime, and crimes where technology has been used to enhance
another crime, such as fraud. It \textbf{provides guidelines} for any
country \textbf{developing domestic laws on cybercrime}and serves as a
basis for international cooperation between parties to the convention
but was later expanded to cover other areas of crime, such as hate
crimes.
\subsection{Original key provisions}
The original convention was adopted in 2004 and covers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the \textbf{criminalisation} of \textbf{conduct}, ranging from
    illegal access, data and systems interference to computer-related
    fraud and dissemination of child abuse material;
  \item \textbf{procedural powers} to \textbf{investigate cybercrime}
    and secure electronic evidence in relation to any crime;
  \item \textbf{efficient international cooperation} between parties.
\end{itemize}

Parties are members of the Cybercrime Convention Committee and:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{share information} and \textbf{experience};
  \item \textbf{assess implementation} of the convention;
  \item \textbf{interpret} the convention through \textbf{guidance
    notes}.
\end{itemize}

Of the 27 Member States, 26 have ratified the convention. Ireland
has signed but not yet ratified it.

\subsection{Additional Protocol 1(2006)}
This protocol extends the scope of the convention to cover xenophobic
and racist propaganda disseminated through computer systems, providing
more protection for victims.\\
It furthermore:
\begin{itemize}
  \item reinforces the legal framework through a set of guidelines for
    criminalising xenophobia and racist propaganda in cyberspace;
  \item enhances the ways and means for international cooperation in the
    investigation and prosecution of racist and xenophobic crimes online.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional Protocol 2(2024)}
This protocol aims to further enhance international cooperation.\\
It addresses the particular challenge of \textbf{electronic evidence}
relating to cybercrime and other offences being held by service
providers in foreign jurisdictions, but with law enforcement powers
limited to national boundaries.\\
Its main features are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a new \textbf{legal basis} permitting a \textbf{direct request
    to registrars} in other jurisdictions to obtain domain name
    registration information;
  \item a new \textbf{legal base} permitting \textbf{direct orders to
    service providers} in \textbf{other jurisdictions} to obtain
    subscriber information;
  \item \textbf{enhanced} means for \textbf{obtaining subscriber
    information} and \textbf{traffic data} through
    government-to-government cooperation;
  \item expedited \textbf{cooperation} in \textbf{emergency
    situations} including the use of joint investigation teams and
    joint investigations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New Global Cybercrime Treaty}
The Budapest Convention has been a model for other countries and 
regions in developing their own cybercrime laws and treaties.\\ 
The \textbf{United Nations} has also been working on a new global 
cybercrime treaty, which would build on the Budapest Convention and 
expand its scope to cover new forms of cybercrime and emerging 
technologies.\\
We will see it later on.

\section{Harmonization of national laws and international cooperation}
\subsection{International Cooperation Provisions}
This provision s based on a very simple principle.
\begin{boxH}
  Parties are to cooperate "to the \textbf{widest extent possible}" in
  investigating electronic evidence.
\end{boxH}
This is necessary because mutual assistance is often slow and can even
take months to complete(3 up to 6).  The Mutual assistance agreement(
thanks to the Cybercrime convention) allows for expedited requests
using "expedited means of communication", which means that, to an
expedited request, one must provide adequate levels of security and
authentication(eg. encrypted communication).\\
Furthermore, parties may share information without a formal request if
it would assist in investigations or help the receiving party with any
related offences.
\subsection{Mutual Assistance Provisions}
Procedural Powers for Assistance grant the ability to expedite the
preservation of stored computer data, as well as the disclosure of
traffic data. In addition, they allow for the real-time collection of
traffic data and the interception of content data. Assistance in these
matters is provided in accordance with domestic laws and applicable
treaties, subject to any reservations.\\
Article 23, which outlines the General Cooperation Principle,
emphasizes that mutual assistance should be offered to the widest
extent possible. This applies specifically to cyber-related offenses
and the collection of electronic evidence for any criminal offense.\\
However, there are restrictions to this cooperation. These limitations
may arise in cases related to extradition, mutual assistance in the
real-time collection of traffic data, and the interception of content
data.
\subsection{24/7 Network for Immediate Assistance}
Each party is required to designate a contact point that is available
24/7. The primary purpose of this contact point is to provide
immediate assistance in cybercrime investigations, legal proceedings,
or the collection of electronic evidence. This system is modeled after
the G8 network of contact points.\\
The goal of this provision is to expedite the processing of urgent
mutual assistance requests by overcoming delays associated with
traditional bureaucratic channels.
